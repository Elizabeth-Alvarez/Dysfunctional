This programs is just like a virus, the user does not have any input as to what is being viewed and how to stop the program
unless it is terminated. This dysfunctional program is simple and it can relate to Amy Alexander’s piece “Scream”, in which
a screaming noise is heard over and over as the images move along the display. Inspired by that piece, I chose to pick a 
similar format in which images are involved and the user has no control of what is being displayed. Once the program begins, 
there is a loop that reveals the images and text over and over again, and the only way to stop it is to terminate the 
program.

The purpose of this project is to reveal the controversy that still exists with tattoos and to provide the importance 
behind why people get permanent ink in their body. Whether the meaning consists of a deep life changing moment to just 
marking the body with images that represent the person's sense of humor. 

I wanted to represent this idea of tattoos by providing random quotes and tattoos that show foolishness to a deeper sense 
of life. For example the cat in the belly tattoo versus the ‘never lose hope’ tattoo. I wanted to allow the viewer to draw 
up their own conclusions and not have a biased side to tattoos. I made sure to provide a dysfunctional piece where the user
can build up their own interpretation of what is being displayed and have an endless time to do so since the program is 
never-ending.
